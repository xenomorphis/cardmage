1. The Motivation
=================
As a child of the 90s, my childhood fell into the late era of the great and glorious trading card
games (TCGs). At the time, I played mostly *Yu-Gi-Oh* (mostly because the accompanying anime
series was probably the best publicity KONAMI could hope for), but I also owned a few
*Magic - The Gathering* cards (even though I had no idea how that game was supposed to work at
the time).

And as a side effect of tinkering with different play styles and strategies, I started designing
my own cards based on the Yu-Gi-Oh rulebook (I guess you could call it a kind of
'fan fiction' - not for comics, but for card games). Back then I wrote them on index cards, just
as plain text without illustrations.

But at the time I'm writing this, it's 2022 and things have changed. Today I would use Photoshop,
GIMP or InDesign - opening up completely new possibilities. A few weeks ago I stumbled upon an
reddit post about the FOSS card game called `Arcmage <https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/wu3sgg/arcmage_a_foss_customizable_card_game/>`_.

I was fascinated by the idea that someone created a community-driven open-source (trading) card
game but at the same time I was quite unsure on how one could solve the technical problems of
working together on something like a card game (at least that's what the term 'community-driven'
is all about).

I don't want to write a bachelor thesis about this topic here (I mean, you *could* definitely use
this as a topic for a bachelor thesis), but just to illustrate the difficulties, let's assume the
following situation:

You somehow managed to assemble a core team of a few skilled people working on the game. This
core team would (best case scenario) consist of

* some people entrusted with game design and supervising it's mechanics,
* some people with an affinity for overall card design, layout etc.,
* and if you're really lucky you'll have one or two fellows doing some artworks in their spare time.

On top of that you probably want to encourage interested players to get involved and give them a
chance to create their own cards and submit them to the team for approval and/or feedback - which
leads to the next requirement: Some kind of discussion forum (and approval processes and other
project management stuff, but that's way beyond the scope here).

After considering all of those 'prerequisites' I came up with one simple idea that ultimately led
to the creation of **CARDmage**: *What if we treat the card game as open-source software? If FOSS
is manageable via Github, why not card games too?*
